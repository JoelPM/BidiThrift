Building this project requires Maven 2.x. Additionally, it also requires that
you have installed a version of libthrift.jar in your local maven repo. This
can be accomplished by downloading one of the instant releases, building it,
and then running the following command:

  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/java/libthrift.jar -DgroupId=org.apache -DartifactId=thrift -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar

With these steps accomplished, you can build the project by running:

  mvn clean package

From within the current directory.

This will build a server executable and a client executable. To start the server do:

  java -jar Server/target/BidiMessages.Server-0.9-jar-with-dependencies.jar 10101

Which will start the server on port 10101.

To start a client do:

  java -jar Client/target/BidiMessages.Client-0.9-jar-with-dependencies.jar client1 localhost 10101

This will start a client with the name client1 that connects to the server running on localhost at port 10101.

You can start as many clients as you'd like (just make sure you give them different names so you can
tell who sent what message).

Currently the client just sends 100 numbered messages and then stops.
